Creates two graphs (dot plot and line) that uses Ct values generated from PCR output. The excel file is set up where multiple plates' standard curves can be added to one graph. The line graph offers the capability of using the superscript value from the calculated concentration of each point. From this the linear equation line and rsquared value is generated.  Using the linear equation line, the calculation for the unknown can be conducted.
